<h2>My story:</h2>

<p> 
    <div>
        I was born with several genetic mutations, <br>
         had to be bottle-fed, and had difficulty being adopted. <br>
        Gabbo Rap had an extreme form of feline  <b> Tamarraggine Autistica </b> <br>
        that caused his limbs and lower jaw to be quite small <br>
            in comparison to the rest of his body.   <br>
            <b> (SUEG) </b>

<h2>My passions:</h2>

<p> 
    <div>
       
       My main passion is gambling,  <br>
        I spend every day betting and playing coupons!!
    </div>
